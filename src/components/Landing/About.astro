        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          I'm Lena, a passionate photographer with over 10 years of experience capturing life's most precious moments. My journey in photography began with a simple love for storytelling through images, and it has evolved into a professional pursuit of creating timeless memories for families, couples, and individuals.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
          My approach to photography is natural and unobtrusive. I believe in capturing authentic moments that reflect the true essence of my subjects. Whether it's a wedding, family portrait, or professional headshot, I strive to create images that tell your unique story.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me exploring new locations, experimenting with different photography techniques, and sharing my knowledge through workshops and mentoring sessions.
