      I'm Lena, and photography isn't just my job - it's my passion. I fell in love with capturing moments when I first picked up a camera, and I've been telling stories through my lens ever since. Every photograph I take is more than just an image; it's a piece of someone's story that I'm honored to preserve.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      I believe that the most beautiful photographs come from genuine moments and authentic connections. That's why I focus on capturing the real you - your laughter, your tears, your quiet moments, and your biggest celebrations. I want to create images that make you feel something every time you look at them, even years down the road.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-600">
      Whether you're planning your dream wedding, celebrating a milestone, or simply want to capture this moment in your life, I'd love to be your photographer. Let's create something beautiful together - something that tells your unique story in a way that feels true to who you are.
